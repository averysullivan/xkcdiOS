## Architecture

- [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) for networking. *duh*
- [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa) as a data store.
- [Fa√ßade](https://github.com/mamaral/Facade) for the UI layout.
- [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage) for image downloading / caching.
- [FLAnimatedImage](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage) for that one GIF.
- [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io/) for beta distribution, analytics, and crash reporting.
- [xkcd-font](https://github.com/ipython/xkcd-font) because obviously.
- Stripped, modified, and customized [Mosaic Layout](https://github.com/betzerra/MosaicLayout) for the comic list.


## Version History
- **v2.5** (Currently in test)
   - Added localization support for Russian, Spanish, Chinese (simplified), and German - the most common languages used currently.
   - Conducting an accessibility audit, making almost the entire app as accessibile as possible.
   - Added "peek-and-pop" support for the comic list. Thanks [@avikantz](https://github.com/avikantz)!
   - Replaced old and busted app review prompting and logic with some new iOS 10.3 hotness.
   - Temporarily removed clear cache as a menu option as I've been running into issues debugging why that isn't working as expected. In the meantime if you *really* want to truly clear everything, delete the app and install fresh.
   - Added support for "offline viewing" by downloading images to disk and implementing a nice clean three-step cache/download/storage solution for images.
   
- **v2.4** (Available for download in the App Store)
   - Bookmarking comics - If you enjoy reading all the comics in order, you can bookmark a comic from the comic screen and we've provided an option from the main comic list to be taken back to where you left off at any time.
   - The "alt" view now includes the comic number as well as a "Explain" button that will take you to the explainXKCD site for that comic, in case you'd like a little more context.
   - View All Unread - quickly filter out all viewed comics, seeing only unread comics in the list.
   - Clear Cache - deletes all comics, resets all saved information including 
   - View Bookmarked Comic - As previously mentioned, when you select this menu option you will be taken back to the comic you bookmarked and can continue browsing in-order.
   - View All Comics - this option will return to the unfiltered list if any of the above filters were applied.
   
- **v2.3**
   - Fixes a comic view controller zooming issue caused by zooming in on a comic, viewing the alt text, then moving to the next/prev comic, resulting in the comic being zoomed out too far.
   - Added a Today Widget showing the most recent comic.
   - Removed GTrack and Google Analytics libraries.
   
- **v2.2**
   - Fixes an issue with some of the known interactive comics, using a web view controller instead of the native comic view controller as a stop-gap until we work out some other solution.
   - Ask users to leave a review, only once ever, to get some more feedback.
   - Swipe navigation between comics.
   - Share sheet.
   - Moved alt button to bottom for easier use on larger devices.
   - Random comics can be viewed from the comic list, making it easier to randomly browse.
