 * sixth app session per version of the app. That seems fairly reasonable as
 * most people will view the app when new comics come out M/W/F, so that would
 * mean after you download a new version you'll be prompted to review on average
 * after two weeks of use. I'm hoping this isn't too much, I guess time will tell!
