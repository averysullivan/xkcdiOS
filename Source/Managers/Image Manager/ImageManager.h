/**
 * The ImageManager class is responsible for keeping a local cache of images
 * used in the app, loading and saving images to disk, and downloading remote
 * images and updating the cache and disk with the recently downloaded images.
 * It also provides a mechanism to cancel previous download handler operations,
 * designed for high performance when used in conjunction with UITableView and
 * UICollectionView cell reuse.

/**
 * Returns an image with a given filename if it's present in our image cache.
 * If the image isn't in the cache but has been previously saved to disk, the
 * image is asynchronously loaded from disk and the handler block is called
 * with that image. If the image is not in our cache or on disk, it is then
 * downloaded from the provided remote url, saved in both the cache and on
 * disk, and the provided handler block is called with the image.
 *
 * @param filename The name of the file that will be used as the key in the image
 * cache and the path for the image to be loaded on or saved to the application's
 * documents directory.
 *
 * @param urlString The string representation of the remote url for this image
 * that will be used to download the image if it is not present in the cache
 * or on disk.
 *
 * @param handler A block that will be called only when an image is
 * not found in our cache and is either loaded from disk or successfully
 * downloaded from the provided url.
 *
 * @return The image loaded from our cache if present; nil otherwise.

 *
 * @discussion If you're using this in a UITableView, UICollectionView, or any other view
 * that implements a reuse/recycle mechanism, you'll want to cancel the download for a given
 * cell or view prior to calling loadImageWithFilename:urlString:handler: again for that
 * same cell or view. This will prevent weird behavior in many cases, such as scrolling
 * very quickly, that may lead to a single image view cycling through multiple images as
 * each of the download operations finishes in an arbitrary order.
